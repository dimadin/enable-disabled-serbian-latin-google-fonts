This plugin enables loading of fonts used by bundled themes (Twenty Thirteen, Twenty Fifteen, Twenty Sixteen, Twenty Seventeen) from Google Fonts that were previously disabled by [Serbian language package](https://sr.wordpress.org/).

Those fonts were disabled by default because they don't support Serbian Cyrillic scripts, but since they do support Serbian Latin scripts this plugin re-enables them. Fonts that support both scripts are already enabled while fonts that do not support either script continue to be disabled.

It is a very lightweight, it has no settings, just activate it and it works immediately.
